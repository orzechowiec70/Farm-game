# Farm-game
It's a game where you control the farmer. Your mission is to throw sandwiches to hungry animals that spawn randomly. <br />
You have 3 lives - then you get the information "Game Over" in the console. You can gain 1 life every 10 points you score. <br />
Right now, the game doesn't stop - it's the next step in development. <br />
Planning to add lives to animals too.
